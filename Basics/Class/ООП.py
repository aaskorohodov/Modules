"""
3 basic principles of OOP:

     - encapsulation
     - inheritance
     - polymorphism

Encapsulation == not only placing methods (and data) inside one object (class), but also hiding them from the user.
I.e. encapsulation are methods that cannot be directly accessed, but they work inside the class.

Inheritance == storing shared data or methods in the parent class.

Polymorphism == the ability to work with different data types in a unified way. Polymorphism means that you can create
base class with a base method, inherit from it child ones and add the base method with additional functionality,
 that is specific for concrete child class.
